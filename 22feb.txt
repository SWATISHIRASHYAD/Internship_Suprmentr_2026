#Multiple Linear Regression
#Let us predict house pricing using area and bedrooms:
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


data={'Area':[1000,1500,2000,2500,3000],
      "Bedrooms":[2,3,3,4,4],
      "Price":[50,70,80,100,120]}
df=pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

X=df[['Area','Bedrooms']]
y=df['Price']
model=LinearRegression()

model.fit(X,y)

new_house=[[3500,5]]
predicted_price=model.predict(new_house)
print("Predicted price for the new house:",predicted_price)

#Assumptions of linear regression

'''
price=b0+b1*area+b2*bedrooms
now model finds:
impact of area,impact of bedrooms, and the intercept
1.MSE 
lower=better

2.R2 score
range:0 to 1
0.9->excellent
0.7->good
0.5->average
<0.3->poor
'''

#assumptions 
#1.Linearity: relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear
#2.Independence: observations are independent
#3.Homoscedasticity: constant variance of errors
#4.Normality: errors are normally distributed
#no multicollinearity: independent variables are not highly correlated with each other
